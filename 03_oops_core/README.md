# OOPS in C++

This folder contains Object-Oriented Programming concepts implemented using C++.

## Concepts
- [ ] Class & Object
- [ ] Constructor & Destructor
- [ ] Encapsulation
- [ ] Inheritance
- [ ] Polymorphism

## Purpose
To build a strong foundation in C++ OOPS for interviews and real-world programming.

## Explain Core Concept of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

### 1. Class & Object



#### **(a) Class:**
- A class is a user-defined data type that groups data members and member functions into a single unit.
- **Explanation:**
  - A class acts as a blueprint for creating objects.
  - It does not occupy memory until an object is created.
- **Syntax:**
```cpp
class class_name {
    // data members
    // functions
};
(b) Object:
An object is an instance of a class that represents a real-world entity and occupies memory.

Explanation:

Objects are created using a class.

They are used to access data members and member functions of the class.

Syntax:

C++

class_name object;

### 💡 VS Code Me Likhne Ke Liye Zaroori Tips:

1.  **Bold Text:** Kisi word ko bold karne ke liye uske dono taraf `**` lagayein (Jaise: `**Explanation**`).
2.  **Code Block:** Code likhne ke liye teen backticks (```) ka use karein. Isse VS Code mein code ka rang badal jayega aur woh alag se dikhega.
3.  **Heading Gap:** Har Heading (`##`) ke upar ek khali line (Blank Line) zaroori hai.
4.  **Table Structure:** Table ke liye `|` symbol ka use karein aur heading ke niche `| :--- | :--- |` wali line zaroori hai, tabhi woh table banega.
