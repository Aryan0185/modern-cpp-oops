# OOPS in C++

This folder contains Object-Oriented Programming concepts
implemented using C++.

## Concepts
- Class & Object
- Constructor & Destructor
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Purpose
To build a strong foundation in C++ OOPS for interviews
and real-world programming.
## Explain core concept of object oriented programing (oop)
##Class & object
## (a) class:
- A class is a user-defined data type that groups data members and member functions into a single unit.
- Explanation :
A class acts as a blueprint for creating objects.
It does not occupy memory until an object is created.
- Syntax :
- Class class_name{
    //function
};
## (b)Object:
- An object is an instance of a class that represents a real-world entity and occupies memory.
- Explanation :
- Objects are created using a class.
They are used to access data members and member functions of the class.
- Syntax :
 class_name object ;
 ## Difference Between Class and Object 
   ## Class	                     ## Object
- Blueprint of an object    - Instance of a class
- Does not occupy memory     - Occupies memory
- Logical entity	         - Physical entity
